# CIRCUIT

Production as a programmable primitive.

Circuit is a creator-first production and royalty infrastructure built for Solana.

It embeds ownership logic directly into the creation layer. Production and monetization are not separate systems. They are unified.

---

## The Structural Problem

Music production and monetization are architecturally disconnected.

Creation tools optimize for workflow.  
Distribution platforms optimize for capture.  

Ownership becomes secondary. Revenue routing becomes opaque.

This misalignment is systemic.

---

## The Insight

The production interface is the highest leverage surface in the creator stack.

If ownership logic lives at the moment of creation:

• Splits become programmable  
• Revenue routing becomes native  
• Mobile devices become economic terminals  
• Distribution becomes composable  

Production is not just a tool.  
It is an economic control point.

## What Circuit Does

Circuit unifies:

• Beat creation  
• Vocal recording  
• Wallet connectivity  
• Visual split allocation  
• Ecosystem growth modeling  

Ownership is embedded at creation, not applied after release.

## Why Solana Mobile

Solana Mobile introduces a wallet-native device class.

Seeker is not simply hardware.  
It is a secure Web3 computing environment.

Circuit turns that environment into:

• A production terminal  
• A programmable revenue surface  
• A creator ownership interface  

Low latency. Low cost. High composability.

## Mechanism Design

Circuit introduces:

1. Creation-first revenue logic  
2. Visual split allocation primitives  
3. Ecosystem growth modeling  
4. Future on-chain enforcement  

As creator adoption increases:

• Community allocation expands  
• Platform risk decreases  
• Revenue logic decentralizes  

This is infrastructure, not a feature set.

## Status

Circuit began as part of the World Labs concept in 2023 and evolved into a Solana-based decentralized application.

This is my first decentralized application.

Circuit explores how production tooling can become a Web3 economic primitive.
