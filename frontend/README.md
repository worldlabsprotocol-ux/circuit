# CIRCUIT

Create music. Own everything. Scale globally.

Circuit is a creator first production and royalty ecosystem built for Solana. It unifies music creation, ownership, and monetization into a single mobile native interface.

Instead of producing in one environment and monetizing in another, Circuit embeds revenue logic at the creation layer.

Built for Solana Mobile.

## Vision

Circuit began as part of the World Labs concept in 2023 and evolved into a Solana based decentralized application.

This is my first decentralized application.  
The challenge was integrating creative production tooling with blockchain aligned ownership logic while maintaining a clean and intuitive interface.

Long term direction:

- On chain split enforcement
- Creator allocation governance
- Licensing marketplace integration
- Mobile first creator economy tooling

Circuit explores how production can become a Web3 economic primitive.
